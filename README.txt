The aim of this project is to create an ensemble machine learning model, which aim will be to predict, as closely as possible, the prices of housing in Poland. 
The dataset was scrapped personally from Otodom.pl site, where both real estate agencies and single owners have the possibility to list their house, 
apartment and so forth on sale or to rent. This project focuses only on the sale department. Each observation is a separate offer of sale in Polish ZÅ‚oty (PLN).

The data was obtained in September of 2020 from Otodom.pl using Scrapy web crawler available in my otodom_scrapper repo. Jupyter Notebook file's and HTML's contents
are the same.
